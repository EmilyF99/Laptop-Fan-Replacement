# Laptop-Fan-Replacement
Replacement of a rattling laptop fan

This was a repair project. This is a retro-active post as the laptop was repaired in Summer 2020
This was a personal laptop of mine that had a loud grinding noise coming from the laptop when it was in use. 
The loud noise sometimes became unberable when the machine was in use and reset once the laptop was restarted. 

In order to repair this laptop I dissambled the laptop, I pinpointed the fault came from the fan so I had a replacement ready.
I checked the laptop for loose components incase something had become perished or snapped and had become caught. 



Once I had located the fan I removed the old fan and checked for physical damage. 
Upon not finding anything obvious I replaced the fan with the spare I had and restarted the laptop. 
The audible grinding noise had gone and I decided the problem was resolved, so I put the laptop back together and tested it for a few hours to see if the problem returned.
